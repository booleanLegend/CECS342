I liked Fortran along with Ruby. This is because it was the first language that I was 
introduced to programming with in high school. We were given the history behind it as a 
reminder to thank the minds of the great people that invented this "genius language" as my 
programming teacher put it. We learned Python instead for that year. 
However, while I couldn't get the search for the value working properly, (althought, you'll
see in the output that sometimes it does and sometimes it doesn't, and I couldn't figure out
why), I managed to understand the syntax and write out the code for it.
Fortran is powerful, and although going out of date now, I believe that somewhere out there
people could come together and still be able to use this language in good practice in some
moment for a comeback of languages, in something that will people's minds.

Also, thank Repl.it that I was able to cheat my way through the shell, so I could use their 
ubuntu VM and gfortran compiler, instead of downloading another compiler or using another VM ;)
